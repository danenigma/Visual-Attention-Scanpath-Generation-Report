abstract="Interest has flourished in studying both the spatial and temporal aspects of eye movement behavior. This has sparked the development of a large number of new methods to compare scanpaths. In the present work, we present a detailed overview of common scanpath comparison measures. Each of these measures was developed to solve a specific problem, but quantifies different aspects of scanpath behavior and requires different data-processing techniques. To understand these differences, we applied each scanpath comparison method to data from an encoding and recognition experiment and compared their ability to reveal scanpath similarities within and between individuals looking at natural scenes. Results are discussed in terms of the unique aspects of scanpath behavior that the different methods quantify. We conclude by making recommendations for choosing an appropriate scanpath comparison measure.",

abstract = "A great need exists in many fields of eye-tracking research for a robust and general method for scanpath comparisons. Current measures either quantize scanpaths in space (string editing measures like the Levenshtein distance) or in time (measures based on attention maps). This paper proposes a new pairwise scanpath similarity measure. Unlike previous measures that either use AOI sequences or forgo temporal order, the new measure defines scanpaths as a series of geometric vectors and compares temporally aligned scanpaths across several dimensions: shape, fixation position, length, direction, and fixation duration. This approach offers more multifaceted insights to how similar two scanpaths are. Eight fictitious scanpath pairs are tested to elucidate the strengths of the new measure, both in itself and compared to two of the currently most popular measures - the Levenshtein distance and attention map correlation.",
